# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive fixing and enhancement of the Self-Hosted Audiobook System to achieve 100% functionality. The system is a dockerized solution for creating and streaming audiobooks from PDF/EPUB files using AI-powered text-to-speech, but currently has multiple broken features and missing implementations that prevent it from working properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Database Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to be properly initialized and connected across all services, so that data persistence works correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the PostgreSQL database SHALL be initialized with all required tables and indexes
2. WHEN any service connects to the database THEN the connection SHALL be established successfully with proper error handling
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use transactions where appropriate and handle failures gracefully
4. WHEN the system shuts down THEN database connections SHALL be closed properly

### Requirement 2: Functional Book Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my audiobook library with full CRUD operations, so that I can organize and access my books effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the frontend THEN I SHALL see a list of all available books with their metadata
2. WHEN I click on a book THEN I SHALL see detailed information including chapters and audio availability
3. WHEN I upload a book file THEN it SHALL be processed and added to the library automatically
4. WHEN I delete a book THEN it SHALL be removed from both database and file system
5. WHEN books are processed THEN their status SHALL be updated in real-time

### Requirement 3: Working Text-to-Speech Pipeline

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert book chapters to audio using AI TTS, so that I can listen to my books as audiobooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request TTS generation for a chapter THEN the system SHALL queue the job and process it asynchronously
2. WHEN TTS processing starts THEN the chapter status SHALL be updated to "processing"
3. WHEN TTS completes successfully THEN the audio file SHALL be saved and the chapter status updated to "completed"
4. WHEN TTS fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and update status to "failed" after max attempts
5. WHEN multiple chapters are queued THEN they SHALL be processed in priority order

### Requirement 4: Functional Audio Streaming

**User Story:** As a user, I want to stream and control audiobook playback, so that I can listen to my books with full media controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click play on a chapter THEN the audio SHALL start streaming immediately
2. WHEN I seek within an audio file THEN the player SHALL support range requests for instant seeking
3. WHEN I pause and resume THEN my position SHALL be maintained accurately
4. WHEN I switch between chapters THEN playback SHALL transition smoothly
5. WHEN I close and reopen the app THEN my progress SHALL be restored from localStorage

### Requirement 5: Complete Web Scraping and Download System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and download books from online sources, so that I can easily add content to my library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for books THEN the system SHALL query Anna's Archive and return relevant results
2. WHEN I select a book to download THEN it SHALL be queued and downloaded automatically
3. WHEN downloads complete THEN books SHALL be automatically parsed and added to the library
4. WHEN downloads fail THEN the system SHALL retry and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN auto-download is enabled THEN the system SHALL periodically search and download new books

### Requirement 6: Working PDF/EPUB Parser

**User Story:** As a user, I want uploaded books to be automatically parsed into chapters, so that they can be converted to audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN it SHALL be parsed into individual chapters with clean text
2. WHEN an EPUB file is uploaded THEN it SHALL be parsed preserving chapter structure and metadata
3. WHEN parsing completes THEN chapters SHALL be saved to the database with proper text content
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided to the user
5. WHEN text is extracted THEN it SHALL be cleaned and formatted for optimal TTS processing

### Requirement 7: Robust Queue Management System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all background jobs to be managed through a reliable queue system, so that processing is efficient and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are added to queues THEN they SHALL be persisted in Redis with proper retry configuration
2. WHEN jobs fail THEN they SHALL be retried with exponential backoff up to maximum attempts
3. WHEN the system restarts THEN queued jobs SHALL be recovered and continue processing
4. WHEN jobs are cancelled THEN they SHALL be removed from the queue and database updated accordingly
5. WHEN queue monitoring is accessed THEN real-time statistics SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 8: Complete Frontend User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a fully functional web interface, so that I can interact with all system features through an intuitive UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the homepage THEN I SHALL see my book library with progress indicators
2. WHEN I navigate to different pages THEN routing SHALL work correctly without errors
3. WHEN I interact with forms THEN validation SHALL work and provide clear feedback
4. WHEN I perform actions THEN loading states and progress indicators SHALL be shown
5. WHEN errors occur THEN user-friendly error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 9: Service Integration and Communication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all microservices to communicate reliably, so that the system functions as a cohesive whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL register with each other and establish communication
2. WHEN service calls are made THEN they SHALL use circuit breakers for resilience
3. WHEN services fail THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL be activated automatically
4. WHEN services recover THEN they SHALL automatically reconnect and resume normal operation
5. WHEN monitoring is accessed THEN service health and communication status SHALL be visible

### Requirement 10: Production-Ready Deployment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to deploy reliably in production, so that it can serve users consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker Compose is used THEN all services SHALL start in the correct order with proper dependencies
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL be properly loaded across all services
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN health checks SHALL verify all components are working
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN services SHALL support horizontal scaling
5. WHEN logs are accessed THEN they SHALL be structured and searchable across all services
