fix: critical security vulnerabilities and performance optimizations

SECURITY FIXES:
- Remove exposed credentials from .env.insecure.backup
- Add input validation and sanitization to TTS API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting (5 requests/minute) to prevent abuse
- Add path traversal protection for file operations
- Enforce SSL/TLS for database connections
- Configure services to run as non-root users in Docker
- Add secure headers middleware and CORS restrictions

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Implement Redis caching layer for TTS results (24h TTL)
- Convert synchronous operations to async processing
- Add database indexes for common queries
- Optimize connection pooling with health checks

HOTFIX RESOLUTIONS:
- Fix shared module dependencies in Docker containers
- Resolve Winston logging module not found errors
- Update build contexts for proper module resolution

Breaking changes:
- TTS text limit reduced from 50,000 to 10,000 characters
- Stricter input validation may reject previously accepted inputs
- Environment variables must be properly configured

Security impact: HIGH
- Credentials must be rotated immediately
- All services require security audit post-deployment

Testing required:
- Verify TTS generation with new validation rules
- Test rate limiting behavior
- Confirm Docker services run as non-root
- Validate caching performance improvements
