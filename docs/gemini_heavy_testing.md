# 🔨 GEMINI HEAVY TESTING ASSIGNMENT

## Claude Manager Instructions for Gemini

### Current Status (Claude's Analysis):
- ✅ **Dockerfiles FIXED**: backend, crawler, parser shared modules
- ✅ **Git Issues UPDATED**: Progress reported to GitHub
- ✅ **Branch**: `gemini/hotfix-fixes` with recent changes
- 🎯 **Next Phase**: Heavy testing and validation

## 🎯 HEAVY TESTING TASKS FOR GEMINI

### Task 1: Docker Build Testing (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Test the fixed Docker builds
docker-compose build backend --no-cache
docker-compose build crawler --no-cache  
docker-compose build parser --no-cache

# Report: Do builds complete successfully?
# Report: Any remaining shared module errors?
```

### Task 2: Service Startup Testing (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Test if services can start and find shared modules
docker-compose up backend -d
docker logs audiobook-backend

docker-compose up crawler -d  
docker logs audiobook-crawler

docker-compose up parser -d
docker logs audiobook-parser

# Report: Do services start without MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors?
```

### Task 3: Frontend Build Investigation (HIGH)
```bash
# Test frontend build with cache clearing
docker-compose build frontend --no-cache
docker-compose up frontend -d
curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -i "title\|audiobook\|blockedge"

# Report: Does frontend serve audiobook app or BlockEdge?
```

### Task 4: Integration Testing (MEDIUM)
```bash
# Test service communication
docker-compose up -d
# Check if backend can reach other services
docker exec audiobook-backend curl -s http://tts-api:8000/health
docker exec audiobook-backend curl -s http://crawler:3001/health

# Report: Can services communicate properly?
```

### Task 5: Database/Redis Connectivity (MEDIUM)
```bash
# Test if services can connect to infrastructure
docker logs audiobook-backend | grep -i "database\|redis"
docker logs audiobook-crawler | grep -i "database\|redis"

# Report: Are database connections working?
```

## 📊 EXPECTED DELIVERABLES FROM GEMINI

1. **Build Test Results**: Success/failure for each service
2. **Startup Logs**: Any remaining errors or issues  
3. **Frontend Investigation**: What app is actually served
4. **Service Health Report**: Which services are functional
5. **Recommended Fixes**: For any remaining issues
