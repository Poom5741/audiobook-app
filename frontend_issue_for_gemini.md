# GEMINI: Fix Frontend Issue #10

## Problem
Frontend serves BlockEdge app (IREC Dashboard) instead of audiobook app

## Evidence
- curl http://localhost:3000 shows "IREC Certificates - BlockEdge Platform"
- Frontend source code is clean audiobook app (no BlockEdge content)
- Docker build serves wrong content

## Task
Fix frontend Dockerfile or build process to serve correct audiobook app

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend, crawler, parser working
- ❌ Frontend serves wrong app content
- Need: Proper audiobook frontend serving

## Expected Deliverable
Working frontend that serves audiobook app (not BlockEdge)
